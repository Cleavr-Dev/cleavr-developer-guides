# Security & Compliance Guidelines

Welcome to the team! While security may not be a major concern for us at this stage, it’s still important to follow basic guidelines to ensure our systems and data remain safe. This document outlines the security practices you should keep in mind as a developer at Cleavr.

## 1. General Security Best Practices

### Password Management

- Use strong, unique passwords for all accounts (e.g., GitHub, Vercel, etc.) or sign in with a secure method like **OAuth**.
- We use **1Password** to store and manage passwords securely. Make sure to use it for all your accounts unless otherwise specified.
- Enable **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** whenever possible to add an extra layer of security.
- Never share passwords, and change them regularly.

### Keep Your Development Environment Updated

- Make sure your development tools and libraries are up-to-date. This helps prevent security vulnerabilities from outdated software.
- Regularly check for updates on tools like **Next.js**, **Node.js**, and other dependencies.

### Access Control

- Only request access to systems and data necessary for your work.
- When team members no longer need access (e.g., after completing a project or leaving the team), ensure their access is revoked.

## 2. Handling Sensitive Data

### Environment Variables

- Use **environment variables** to store sensitive information like API keys and passwords. Never hardcode this data into the codebase.
- Make sure environment variables are only accessible in secure locations and not accidentally shared in public repositories.

### HTTPS for Secure Communication

- Always ensure that communication between clients and servers is encrypted using **HTTPS**.
- This is handled automatically by our hosting platform (Vercel), but it’s something to be mindful of during development.

## 3. API Key Management

API keys give access to important services and should always be handled carefully to avoid unauthorized access.

### Key Storage

- **Never commit API keys to the repository.** Store them in environment variables or use secret management tools like **GitHub Secrets**.
- For local development, use `.env` files to securely store API keys. Ensure `.env` files are added to `.gitignore` to prevent them from being tracked in version control.

### Key Usage

- **Limit key permissions**: Only use API keys with the minimum permissions necessary for the task at hand.
- If an API key is compromised or no longer needed, **revoke and regenerate** it immediately.

### Key Rotation

- Rotate API keys periodically or when a team member who had access to the key leaves the company.
- Ensure that the rotated keys are updated in the appropriate environment configurations (e.g., on Vercel, GitHub, or any other service).

## 4. Basic Compliance

Even though security concerns are low, it’s important to stay compliant with general industry standards.

### Data Privacy

- Handle customer data with care, even if we don’t manage highly sensitive information.
- Avoid storing unnecessary personal data and make sure any personal information is kept secure.

## 5. Simple Incident Response

If you encounter any potential security issues—whether it’s a suspicious email or unusual behavior in the system—please report it to the **Head of Development** right away. While we don't expect major threats, it’s important to stay alert.

### What to Do in Case of a Security Issue

1. **Identify the Issue**: If something doesn’t seem right (e.g., suspicious activity in your account), take note.
2. **Report**: Contact the Head of Development with details as soon as possible.
3. **Action Plan**: We’ll work together to resolve the issue and, if needed, restore the affected systems.

## 6. Tools & Resources

Here are some simple tools to help keep things secure:

- **1Password**: For managing passwords securely.
- **npm audit**: For checking for vulnerabilities in your dependencies.

## 7. Final Thoughts

We don’t have extensive security measures in place because they aren’t necessary at this stage, but following these simple guidelines will help keep our systems and data safe. If you ever have questions about security or encounter issues, feel free to reach out!
