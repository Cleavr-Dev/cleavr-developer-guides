# Testing & QA

Welcome to the Testing & QA documentation. This guide explains our approach to writing and running tests for `Cleavr`. Currently, we are in the process of building a comprehensive test suite, with a strong focus on integration and end-to-end (E2E) testing using **Playwright**.

---

## 1. Why Testing Matters

Testing is a critical part of our development process. It ensures that our application is stable, reliable, and meets the expected requirements before it reaches production. By writing a comprehensive test suite, we aim to:

- **Prevent regressions**: Ensure that new code doesn‚Äôt break existing features.
- **Improve code quality**: Catch bugs early and reduce the number of bugs in production.
- **Increase developer confidence**: Make changes and ship features without fear of introducing bugs.

---

## 2. Types of Tests

### Unit Tests

These tests validate individual components or functions in isolation. Each unit test checks whether a small piece of code behaves as expected. While our current focus is on integration and end-to-end testing, we encourage writing unit tests for critical components and utilities.

### Integration Tests

Integration tests verify that different parts of the application work together as expected. This can include checking interactions between components, data flow, or API responses.

### End-to-End (E2E) Tests

E2E tests simulate user behavior to verify the application as a whole. They ensure that the app behaves as expected from a user‚Äôs perspective‚Äînavigating through the app, filling forms, interacting with the UI, etc.

**For our E2E tests, we will be using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/).**

## 3. Playwright for End-to-End Testing

Playwright is a powerful library that enables us to automate and test real-world scenarios across different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari). Our goal is to use Playwright to:

- Simulate complex user interactions.
- Test across multiple browsers.
- Run tests in CI/CD pipelines to ensure the app is stable before it gets deployed.

### Getting Started with Playwright

1. **Create your first Playwright test**:
    Playwright tests are typically written in TypeScript. Here‚Äôs an example of a basic test:

    ```ts
    const { test, expect } = require('@playwright/test');

    test('basic test', async ({ page }) => {
      await page.goto('https://example.com');
      const title = await page.title();
      expect(title).toBe('Example Domain');
    });
    ```

1. **Run Playwright tests**:
    After writing your first test, run it with:

    ```bash
    npx playwright test
    ```

1. **Generating Test Reports**:
    Playwright comes with a built-in test runner that supports reporting:

    ```bash
    npx playwright show-report
    ```

### Key Playwright Features

- **Cross-browser support**: Playwright allows us to test across multiple browsers (Chromium, WebKit, Firefox).
- **Automatic waits**: Playwright auto-waits for elements to be ready before performing actions.
- **Network Interception**: Simulate different network conditions and handle requests.
- **Headless and headful modes**: Run tests without a browser UI or with one for debugging.

## 4. Testing Strategy

Given that much of the application has already been developed, our focus will be on **retrospective testing**‚Äîadding tests for existing features to ensure their stability and reliability. Our approach will prioritize integration and end-to-end testing, ensuring the application functions correctly as a whole.

We will begin by:

1. **Writing Integration Tests for Critical Features**: Start by writing integration tests for key features and modules that are essential to the app‚Äôs functionality.
2. **Core E2E Tests**: Develop end-to-end tests for high-impact user flows (e.g., user login, data submission flows).
3. **Automating Tests in CI/CD**: As we introduce tests, we will integrate them into our CI/CD pipeline to catch any regressions or issues early during future updates.

### Example User Flow to Test

One of the first user flows we will write E2E tests for is the **user login flow**:

- Test the login page loads correctly.
- Simulate a user entering valid credentials and successfully logging in.
- Ensure incorrect credentials trigger an error message.
- Verify that after logging in, the user is redirected to the correct page.

## 5. Best Practices for Writing Tests

### Organizing Tests

- **Test Structure**: Organize tests by feature or page.

    ```plaintext
    /tests
      /e2e
        login.spec.ts
        dashboard.spec.ts
      /integration
        components.spec.ts
    ```

- **Describe Blocks**: Use `describe` blocks to group related tests.
- **Before Each Hooks**: Use `beforeEach` hooks to set up common test conditions, like navigating to a page or logging in.

### Writing Clear and Maintainable Tests

- **Keep tests small and focused**: Each test should focus on a single piece of functionality.
- **Avoid hardcoded data**: Use factories or mocks to generate dynamic data for tests.
- **Be specific in assertions**: Ensure that assertions check the actual behavior, not just presence (e.g., `expect(page.locator('.message')).toHaveText('Success')`).

### Documenting Tests

- Write **JSDoc comments** for test files or complex tests, explaining what‚Äôs being tested and why.

## 6. Running Tests

We encourage running tests locally before opening a pull request to ensure that no breaking changes are introduced.

### Running Tests Locally

To run all tests locally, use:

```bash
npm run test
```

### Running Tests in CI

All tests will automatically run in our CI pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, CircleCI) for every pull request. Ensure your tests pass before merging.

## 7. Future Plans

Our ultimate goal is to achieve comprehensive test coverage. As we scale, we will:

- Expand our test suite to cover all user flows and critical features.
- Continuously integrate tests into our CI/CD pipeline to improve reliability.
- Perform periodic audits of test coverage to ensure that newly introduced features are being tested adequately.
