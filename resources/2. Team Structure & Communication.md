# Team Structure & Communication

Effective communication and a clear team structure are essential to maintaining a productive and collaborative environment. This document outlines our current team setup, the roles and responsibilities of each member, and the tools and practices we use to communicate effectively, especially given our remote and distributed nature.

## Team Structure

Our development team is composed of 3-4 members, including myself as Head of Development, an intermediate developer, and one to two senior developers based in Mexico.

We are a distributed team with developers in timezones ranging from UTC-5 to UTC-8. While we aim to have some overlap in working hours, we also encourage asynchronous communication to accommodate different schedules.

### Roles & Responsibilities

1. **Head of Development (Max Gordon)**  
   - Oversees the overall development process.
   - Sets the technical direction and architecture of projects.
   - Acts as a mentor and guide for the development team.
   - Responsible for final decisions on technical matters, code reviews, and deployment approvals.

2. **Senior Developers**  
   - Take ownership of key features and technical initiatives.
   - Lead the design and implementation of complex systems.
   - Provide mentorship and guidance to the intermediate developer.
   - Collaborate on establishing and maintaining coding standards and best practices.
   - Help with code reviews and assist in resolving any technical blockers.

3. **Intermediate Developer (Jonathan Gordon)**  
   - Contributes to the development and implementation of new features.
   - Works closely with senior developers to learn and improve technical skills.
   - Assists with debugging, fixing bugs, and working on smaller tasks and enhancements.
   - Takes part in code reviews and integrates feedback from senior developers.

### Responsibilities Shared by All Team Members

- **Code Quality**: All team members are responsible for maintaining high code quality, following coding standards, and writing clean, maintainable code.
- **Communication**: Regularly update the team on progress, blockers, and any issues that may arise. Be proactive in seeking help when needed.
- **Collaboration**: Work together to solve problems, share knowledge, and support each other in achieving our goals.
- **Continuous Learning**: Stay up-to-date with new technologies, tools, and best practices to improve your skills and contribute to the team’s growth.
- **Feedback**: Provide constructive feedback to your peers and be open to receiving feedback yourself. This helps everyone grow and improve their skills.
- **Documentation**: Contribute to the team’s knowledge base by documenting processes, technical decisions, and best practices.
- **Codebase and Process Improvements**: Suggests enhancements to the codebase and development processes.

### Future Growth

As we expand our development team, we aim to maintain a flat hierarchy that encourages collaboration and knowledge sharing. New team members will be onboarded with the same care and attention to ensure they integrate smoothly into our existing workflows.

## Communication Tools

To ensure smooth communication and collaboration across different time zones and locations, we use the following tools:

- **Slack**: Our primary communication tool for daily updates, quick questions, and asynchronous discussions. We have dedicated channels for projects and development (`#dev`, `#project-cleavr`), and direct messages for one-on-one conversations.
- **GitHub**: Used for version control, code collaboration, and pull requests. Code reviews are essential for maintaining quality, and all team members are expected to participate.
- **Google Meet**: For video calls, including team stand-ups, sprint planning, and one-on-one meetings.
- **Linear**: For managing tasks, tracking progress, and sprint planning. Each developer is responsible for updating the status of their tasks regularly.
- **GitHub Wiki**: For documenting processes, technical decisions, and team knowledge, including this onboarding wiki.

## Communication Practices

### 1. **Daily Stand-ups** (Async-friendly)

- We hold a daily check-in to ensure everyone is aligned:
  - What you worked on yesterday.
  - What you're working on today and an updated estimate on when you think it will be done.
  - Any blockers or assistance needed.
- If someone cannot attend live, they can update via Slack in the dedicated channel (#cleavr-stand-up).

### 2. **Bi-Weekly Sprint Planning**

- Each sprint is two weeks long, with a clear goal and set of tasks to complete.
- On the Monday starting each sprint, we:
  - Review the previous sprint’s outcomes.
  - Plan the work for the upcoming sprint and assign tasks.
  - Discuss upcoming priorities and adjust as needed.
- We aim for focused and efficient meetings to maximize development time.

### 3. **Code Reviews**

- Every pull request requires a review by one or more team members. Initially, all developers will have their code reviewed by the Head of Development.
- Reviews should focus on both code quality and maintaining a collaborative, learning-oriented environment.
- Reviewers will provide feedback to ensure consistency and improve the developer’s skills.
- We strive to review pull requests within 24 hours to keep the workflow moving smoothly.

### 4. **Ad-hoc Collaboration**

- If a team member is stuck, they should reach out on Slack for support from others.
- We encourage regular pair programming, especially between the intermediate developer and senior developers, to solve complex problems and foster learning.

### 5. **Retrospectives**

- At the end of each sprint, we hold a retrospective to:
  - Celebrate what went well.
  - Identify areas for improvement.
  - Adjust processes as needed to optimize team performance.
- Retrospectives help us continuously improve both communication and our workflow.

### 6. **Documentation and Knowledge Sharing**

- We maintain a shared knowledge base on GitHub Wiki to document processes, technical decisions, and best practices.
- All team members are encouraged to contribute to the wiki and share their insights and learnings with the team.

## Best Practices for Distributed Teams

1. **Keep Communication Transparent and Open**  
   - Given our distributed team, it's crucial to over-communicate updates, blockers, and project status to prevent misunderstandings.
      - Being blocked is not an excuse for inactivity. It is imperative to communicate any issues up the chain and seek assistance promptly.

1. **Acknowledge Uncertainty**
   - It's better to openly admit when you don't know something. This transparency helps the team understand where additional support or information might be needed.

1. **Raise Concerns Early**
   - When you foresee potential issues, raising a flag early allows the team to address the problem collectively. This prevents larger setbacks and ensures that everyone can contribute to finding a solution.

1. **Be Proactive in Offering and Asking for Help**  
   - Whether you’re facing a technical issue or need clarification, it’s important to be proactive

1. **Encourage Knowledge Sharing**
   - Regularly share insights, learnings, and best practices with the team to foster a culture of continuous learning and improvement.

1. **Feedback is Key**
   - Provide constructive feedback to your peers and be open to receiving feedback yourself. This helps everyone grow and improve their skills.

1. **Celebrate Wins and Milestones**
   - Acknowledge and celebrate achievements, whether they’re big or small. This helps boost morale and reinforces a positive team culture.
