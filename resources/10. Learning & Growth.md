## 3. Learning from Your Team

We highly encourage learning from within the team through:

- **Code Reviews**: Every code review is an opportunity to learn. Take time to review other people's work, as it helps you understand how others solve problems and approach coding challenges.
- **Knowledge Sharing Sessions**: Participate in internal knowledge-sharing sessions where we discuss new tools, patterns, or lessons learned from ongoing projects.
- **Pair Programming**: When appropriate, try pair programming. This helps build collaborative skills and allows for knowledge exchange in real-time.

---

## 4. Setting Personal Learning Goals

To grow effectively, we encourage you to set **learning goals**. These can include:

- **Technical Goals**: Improving your skills in TypeScript, testing, or mastering new technologies.
- **Soft Skills**: Enhancing communication, teamwork, or leadership skills.
- **New Tools & Frameworks**: Exploring emerging technologies or improving proficiency in existing ones like Next.js or Playwright.

Review your learning goals periodically, and discuss them during your regular feedback sessions with the Head of Development.

## 5. Encouragement to Share & Teach

One of the best ways to learn is by teaching others. If you’ve recently learned something new or figured out a great solution to a tricky problem, share it with the team! This can be done through:

- **Internal Presentations**: Hosting short presentations on topics of interest.
- **Writing Blog Posts**: Contributing to our team knowledge base with blog posts on topics you are passionate about.
- **Mentoring**: As you grow, consider mentoring other developers on the team. Sharing knowledge solidifies your own understanding and strengthens the team.

## 7. Growth Is a Team Effort

Remember, your growth benefits the entire team. As you grow as a developer, you bring new ideas, solutions, and skills to Cleavr, helping us improve as a whole. We’re committed to supporting your professional development, so if you ever need resources or guidance, don’t hesitate to ask!

Welcome aboard, and let’s keep learning and growing together!
