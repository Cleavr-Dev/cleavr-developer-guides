# Deployment Process

This document outlines the process for deploying code to our **staging** and **production** environments. As of now, only the **Head of Development** is authorized to deploy to these environments.

---

## 1. Overview

We use **Vercel** as our hosting platform, and deployments are fully automated through a **CI/CD pipeline**. Deployments are triggered whenever changes are merged into specific branches in the remote GitHub repository:

- **Staging**: Changes merged into the `staging` branch will automatically trigger a deployment to the staging environment.
- **Production**: Changes merged into the `main` branch will automatically trigger a deployment to the production environment.

Both environments are automatically built and deployed by Vercel with the latest changes, ensuring the deployment process is streamlined and reliable.

---

## 2. Deployment Permissions

- **Staging & Production**: Currently, only the **Head of Development** is authorized to merge changes into the `staging` and `main` branches, which directly controls deployment to staging and production.
- **Pull Requests (PRs)**: All changes must go through a **PR review** before being merged. Once reviewed and approved, the Head of Development will merge the PR into the appropriate branch to trigger the deployment.

---

## 3. Deployment Workflow

Here’s a detailed step-by-step workflow for how code is deployed to staging and production environments.

### 1. Development Phase

- Developers work on feature branches (or bugfix branches).
- After completing their work, they open a **Pull Request (PR)** to either the `staging` or `main` branch.
- Ensure all tests pass and that the PR follows our [Code Style & Best Practices](5.%20Code%20Style%20&%20Best%20Practices.md) guidelines.

### 2. Code Review

- A code review is mandatory before any PR is merged.
- The reviewer (Head of Development or senior developers) will provide feedback and request changes if necessary.
- Once the PR is approved, it will be ready for merging.

### 3. Merging & Deployment to Staging

- The **Head of Development** merges the PR into the `staging` branch.
- Once the merge is complete, the **CI/CD pipeline** automatically kicks off the build process in Vercel.
- Vercel will deploy the latest changes to the staging environment.
- After deployment, the changes can be tested in staging to ensure everything works as expected.

### 4. Promotion to Production

- Once changes have been tested and verified in staging, the **Head of Development** merges the PR into the `main` branch.
- This triggers a production build and deployment in Vercel.
- The latest changes will go live on the production environment after the deployment completes.

## 4. Environment URLs

- **Staging Environment**: [https://stg.cleavr.com](https://staging.cleavr.com)
- **Production Environment**: [https://app.cleavr.com](https://www.cleavr.com)

Both environments are automatically updated when a deployment is triggered.

## 5. Vercel CI/CD Integration

Our project is integrated with Vercel for automated deployments. The steps below outline what happens during each deployment:

1. **Build Process**: Vercel will start by pulling the latest code from the GitHub branch (`staging` or `main`).
2. **Build Execution**: Vercel will run the build for our Next.js application, including any optimizations and preprocessing tasks (such as static site generation).
3. **Deployment**: Once the build completes successfully, Vercel deploys the new version to the respective environment (staging or production).

If the build fails for any reason, Vercel will notify the team via email or other configured alerts.

---

## 6. Rollback Process

In case an issue is detected post-deployment in production, we can quickly roll back to a previous deployment using Vercel's **rollback feature**. Here's how to initiate a rollback:

1. Log in to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/dashboard).
2. Navigate to the project dashboard.
3. Select the **production environment**.
4. Identify the previous successful deployment you want to roll back to.
5. Click **"Revert"** to deploy the previous version.

This will restore the last stable version of the app.

## 7. Post-Deployment Checklist

After each deployment, the following checks should be performed:

- **Staging**:
  - Ensure that the application behaves as expected in the staging environment.
  - Run any required end-to-end tests manually or via Playwright to validate the user experience.
  - Verify that critical paths (login, form submissions, etc.) work without issues.

- **Production**:
  - Once deployed to production, monitor the application for any issues or bugs.
  - Ensure that critical user flows are functioning correctly.
  - Check Vercel's logs and error reporting for any deployment errors.

---

## 8. Additional Notes

- Only merge into the `staging` and `main` branches when you are certain the code is ready for deployment.
- Always ensure that staging deployments have been thoroughly tested before promoting to production.
- Use **GitHub Actions** or the CI tools available to ensure all tests pass before any code is merged.

For any questions about the deployment process or if you encounter issues during deployment, please reach out to the Head of Development.
