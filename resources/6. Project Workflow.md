# Project Workflow

Welcome to the Project Workflow guide. This document explains the steps, processes, and best practices involved in completing tasks and shipping features efficiently within our development team.

## 1. Development Lifecycle

### Task Assignment

Tasks are assigned through [Linear](https://linear.app/drawbackwards/team/CLV/cycle/active). Each task will have a description, requirements, and acceptance criteria. Before starting any work, ensure you fully understand the task and clarify any doubts with the Head of Development.

### Starting a Task

1. **Select a Task**: Pick a task from the backlog or current sprint and assign it to yourself.
2. **Understand Requirements**: Review the task description, check for any related designs, and clarify with the Head of Development or the Designer if needed.
3. **Break Down the Task**: If a task is large or complex, break it down into smaller, manageable subtasks.

### Definition of Done

For a task to be considered "done", it must meet the following criteria:

- Code is complete and adheres to [Code Style & Best Practices](5.%20Code%20Style%20&%20Best%20Practices.md).
- Unit tests and other necessary tests are written and passing.
- Code has been reviewed by at least one other team member.
- There are no unresolved issues or comments from the code review.

## 2. Issue Tracking & Task Management

### Issue Reporting

Use Linear to report bugs or feature requests. When creating an issue, use the following template:

- **Title**: A clear, concise title.
- **Description**: Detailed explanation of the issue or feature request.
- **Steps to Reproduce** (for bugs): Provide steps to replicate the bug.
- **Expected vs. Actual Results**: What should happen vs. what happens.
- **Attachments**: Any screenshots, logs, or other helpful resources.
- **Priority**: Urgency of the issue (e.g., critical, high, medium, low).
- **Labels**: Add tags/labels to categorize the issue (e.g., bug, feature, enhancement).

### Task Prioritization

Tasks are prioritized based on:

- Urgency (e.g., critical bugs).
- Value to the customer or project goals.
- Technical complexity.
- Dependencies on other features.

### Sprint Workflow

Tasks move through stages:

- **Todo**: Tasks ready for work.
- **In Progress**: Tasks actively being worked on.
- **Dev Review**: Tasks awaiting code review. A PR has been created and another team has been tagged for review.
- **Design Review**: Tasks requiring design approval. On the ticket, tag the designer for review and include a link to the vercel preview environment for that ticket. Once approved, the PR can be merged and the task moved to QA Review.
- **QA Review**: Tasks ready for deployed to staging, awaiting QA approval. Once approved, the commits associated with this task can be deployed, and the ticket can be moved to Done.
- **Done**: Tasks that have been merged and deployed to production.

### Sprint Planning

- **Sprint Goals**: Define the objectives for the sprint.
- **Task Estimation**: Estimate the points or time required for each task. **1 point = 1 hour**. We use the Fibonacci sequence for point allocation (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, etc.).
- **Task Breakdown**: If any task is larger than 8 points, break it down into smaller subtasks.
- **Task Assignment**: Assign tasks to team members based on availability and expertise.
- **Capacity Planning**: Ensure the team has the capacity to complete the sprint goals. Ideally, team members should accomplish between 5-10 points per day.

## 3. Branching and Version Control

We follow a [Git Workflow](4.%20Version%20Control%20with%20Git.md) for version control. All work is done in separate branches.

When starting a new task:

1. **Create a Branch**: Create a new branch from `dev` with a descriptive name (e.g., `feature/new-feature`).
    - This will also create a new environment on Vercel for your branch, and a new database branch in Neon for your branch.
2. **Work on the Task**: Make your changes, commit frequently, and push your branch to the remote repository.

## 4. Testing Guidelines

As of writing, the codebase only has 1 smoke test that ensures the app builds and runs. This is not sufficient for ensuring the quality of the application. We are working on improving our testing coverage.

This is an area where we need to improve, and we encourage all team members to contribute to writing tests for new features and existing code and suggesting improvements to our testing strategy.

---

## 5. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

We use GitHub Actions with Vercel for CI/CD to automate builds, tests, and deployments.

When you create a PR, GitHub Actions will run several checks, including linting, formatting, type checking, tests, building, and deploying the preview environment. If any checks fail, address the issues and push the changes to the branch.

Once the PR is approved and merged, the changes will be automatically deployed to the development environment.

Similarly for staging and production, changes are deployed automatically after passing all checks and approvals.

## 6. Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during the development process, don't hesitate to reach out for help. We're here to support you and ensure you have everything you need to succeed.
