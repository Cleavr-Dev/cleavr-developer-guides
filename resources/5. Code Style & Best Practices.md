# Code Style & Best Practices

This document outlines the coding standards and best practices for contributing to our codebase. By following these guidelines, we ensure that our code is readable, maintainable, and consistent across the team.

## TypeScript Guidelines

We strictly adhere to TypeScript for type safety and improved code clarity. Below are the key rules we follow regarding TypeScript usage:

- **No `as any` is allowed**: The use of `as any` is prohibited unless explicitly approved by the Head of Development. This is to avoid bypassing TypeScript’s type checking.
  
- **Avoid using `as` for type assertions**, except in the following cases:
  - When specifying the type of an array or object that is the starting value in a `.reduce()` function:

    ```typescript
    const result = items.reduce((acc, item) => acc.concat(item), [] as ItemType[]);
    ```

  - When using `as const` to define constant values:

    ```typescript
    const DIRECTIONS = ['north', 'south', 'east', 'west'] as const;
    ```
  
- **Prefer using `satisfies`**: This allows you to validate that an object or value satisfies a specific type, without forcing unnecessary type assertions. It also does not obscure the type of the object like `as` does.

  ```typescript
  const config = {
    url: '/api/data',
    method: 'GET',
  } satisfies ApiConfig;
  ```

- **Use `const` by default**: All variables should be declared using `const` unless their values need to be reassigned. In that case, `let` can be used. `var` is not acceptable under any circumstance.

## General Coding Best Practices

### 1. Consistent Formatting

- Formatting is provided by Prettier, which is enforced through ESLint. Make sure to configure your code editor to format on save to maintain consistent code style.

### 2. Name Variables, Functions, and Components Intelligently

- Names should be descriptive, human-readable, and relevant to their purpose.
- Avoid abbreviations that could confuse others. Instead, use full, meaningful names.
- Use `camelCase` for variables and functions, `PascalCase` for components, and `UPPER_CASE` for constants.

**Examples**:

- Variables and functions in `camelCase`:

    ```typescript
    const userName = 'JohnDoe';
    function getUserAge(userId: number): number {
      // function logic here
    }
    ```

- Components in `PascalCase`:

    ```typescript
    import React, { FC } from 'react';

    const UserProfile: FC<UserProfileProps> = () => {
      return <div>User Profile</div>;
    };

    export default UserProfile;
    ```

- Constants in `UPPER_CASE`:

    ```typescript
    const MAX_USERS = 100;
    const API_ENDPOINT = 'https://api.example.com';
    ```

### 3. Document Your Code with JSDoc

- Use JSDoc comments to document functions, components, and utility functions, especially those that are reusable. JSDoc enhances code readability and assists other developers in understanding the purpose and usage of your code.
- Provide descriptions for parameters, return values, and any potential side effects.

**Example**:

  ```typescript
  /**
   * Calculates the sum of two numbers.
   */
  function add(a: number, b: number): number {
    return a + b;
  }
  ```

  ```typescript
  /**
   * Fetches user data from the API.
   *
   * @param {string} userId - The ID of the user.
   * @returns A promise that resolves to the user data.
   */
  async function fetchUserData(userId: string): Promise<User> {
    const response = await fetch(`${API_ENDPOINT}/users/${userId}`);
    const data = userDataSchema.parse(await response.json());
    return data;
  }
  ```

### 4. Avoid Deep Nesting

- Deeply nested code can become difficult to read and maintain. Try to flatten your code by breaking down complex logic into smaller, reusable functions.

**Example**:

```typescript
// Bad (deeply nested)
const processData = () => {
  if (conditionA) {
    if (conditionB) {
      if (conditionC) {
        // Do something
      }
    }
  }
};

// Good (flattened logic)
const processData = () => {
  if (!conditionA) return;
  if (!conditionB) return;
  if (!conditionC) return;
  // Do something
};
```

### 5. Error Handling

- Always handle errors gracefully by using `try-catch` blocks or `.catch()` with promises.
- Provide meaningful error messages to aid in debugging and troubleshooting.

**Example**:

```typescript
try {
  const data = await fetchData();
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Error fetching data:', error.message);
}
```

### 6. Avoid Magic Numbers and Strings

- Avoid using raw numbers or strings directly in your code. Instead, define them as constants to improve code readability and maintainability.

**Example**:

```typescript
// Bad (magic number)
if (age >= 18) {
  // Do something
}

// Good (constant)
const MIN_AGE = 18;
if (age >= MIN_AGE) {
  // Do something
}
```

## The Zen of Python (Adapted for TypeScript)

Inspired by Python’s philosophy, here are the principles we apply to our code:

1. **Beautiful is better than ugly**: Write code that is clean and elegant.
1. **Explicit is better than implicit**: Avoid magic numbers and hidden dependencies.
1. **Simple is better than complex**: Strive for simplicity. Complex solutions should be avoided unless absolutely necessary.
1. **Complex is better than complicated**: If complexity is unavoidable, ensure it is well-structured and understandable.
1. **Readability counts**: Code is written for humans first, machines second. Prioritize readability.
1. **Special cases aren’t special enough to break the rules**: Stick to best practices consistently, even for edge cases.
1. **Errors should never pass silently**: Handle errors properly with clear logging or error messages.
1. **In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess**: Make your code and intentions clear.
1. **There should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it**: Avoid unnecessary variation in how tasks are accomplished within the codebase.
1. **If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea**: Code should be easily explainable to other team members.

## Best Practices for Writing Functions

- **Keep functions short and focused**: Each function should perform a single task.
- **Avoid side effects**: A function should ideally take inputs and return outputs without modifying external state.
- **Write pure functions when possible**: Functions that don’t depend on or modify the outside world (inputs and outputs only) are easier to test and reason about.

**Example**:

```typescript
// Bad (side effects)
let total = 0;
const calculateTotal = (price: number) => {
  total += price;
};

// Good (pure function)
const calculateTotal = (price: number, currentTotal: number): number => {
  return currentTotal + price;
};
```

## Testing and Code Quality

- **Write Tests**: Every new feature or component should be accompanied by unit tests. We use Jest for testing.
- **Test edge cases**: Ensure your code handles all possible scenarios, especially error cases.
- **Run tests locally**: Before opening a pull request, run the test suite to confirm that all tests pass.

## Code Review Guidelines

- **Peer review is essential**: Every pull request should go through code review by at least one other team member.
- **Be kind and constructive**: Use code reviews as a way to help each other grow and to maintain code quality.
- **Focus on the code, not the person**: Feedback should always be about improving the code, not criticizing the developer.

By following these guidelines, we can ensure that our code remains maintainable, scalable, and easy to collaborate on. If you ever have any questions about these practices or need clarification, don’t hesitate to reach out!

Happy coding!
