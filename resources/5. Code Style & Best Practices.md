# Code Style & Best Practices

This document outlines the coding standards and best practices for contributing to our codebase. By following these guidelines, we ensure that our code is readable, maintainable, and consistent across the team.

## TypeScript Guidelines

We strictly adhere to TypeScript for type safety and improved code clarity. Below are the key rules we follow regarding TypeScript usage:

- **No `as any` is allowed**: The use of `as any` is prohibited unless explicitly approved by the Head of Development. This is to avoid bypassing TypeScript’s type checking.
  
- **Avoid using `as` for type assertions**, except in the following cases:
  - When specifying the type of an array or object that is the starting value in a `.reduce()` function:

    ```typescript
    const result = items.reduce((acc, item) => acc.concat(item), [] as ItemType[]);
    ```

  - When using `as const` to define constant values:

    ```typescript
    const DIRECTIONS = ['north', 'south', 'east', 'west'] as const;
    ```
  
- **Prefer using `satisfies`**: This allows you to validate that an object or value satisfies a specific type, without forcing unnecessary type assertions. It also does not obscure the type of the object like `as` does.

  ```typescript
  const config = {
    url: '/api/data',
    method: 'GET',
  } satisfies ApiConfig;
  ```

- **Use `const` by default**: All variables should be declared using `const` unless their values need to be reassigned. In that case, `let` can be used. `var` is not acceptable under any circumstance.

## General Coding Best Practices

### 1. Consistent Formatting

- Formatting is provided by Prettier, which is enforced through ESLint. Make sure to configure your code editor to format on save to maintain consistent code style.

### 2. Name Variables, Functions, and Components Intelligently

- Names should be descriptive, human-readable, and relevant to their purpose.
- Avoid abbreviations that could confuse others. Instead, use full, meaningful names.
- Use `camelCase` for variables and functions, `PascalCase` for components, and `UPPER_CASE` for constants.

**Examples**:

- Variables and functions in `camelCase`:

    ```typescript
    const userName = 'JohnDoe';
    function getUserAge(userId: number): number {
      // function logic here
    }
    ```

- Components in `PascalCase`:

    ```typescript
    import React, { FC } from 'react';

    const UserProfile: FC<UserProfileProps> = () => {
      return <div>User Profile</div>;
    };

    export default UserProfile;
    ```

- Constants in `UPPER_CASE`:

    ```typescript
    const MAX_USERS = 100;
    const API_ENDPOINT = 'https://api.example.com';
    ```

### 3. Document Your Code with JSDoc

- Use JSDoc comments to document functions, components, and utility functions, especially those that are reusable. JSDoc enhances code readability and assists other developers in understanding the purpose and usage of your code.
- Provide descriptions for parameters, return values, and any potential side effects.

**Example**:

  ```typescript
  /**
   * Calculates the sum of two numbers.
   */
  function add(a: number, b: number): number {
    return a + b;
  }
  ```

  ```typescript
  /**
   * Fetches user data from the API.
   *
   * @param {string} userId - The ID of the user.
   * @returns A promise that resolves to the user data.
   */
  async function fetchUserData(userId: string): Promise<User> {
    const response = await fetch(`${API_ENDPOINT}/users/${userId}`);
    const data = userDataSchema.parse(await response.json());
    return data;
  }
  ```

### 4. Avoid Deep Nesting

- Deeply nested code can become difficult to read and maintain. Try to flatten your code by breaking down complex logic into smaller, reusable functions.

**Example**:

```typescript
// Bad (deeply nested)
const processData = () => {
  if (conditionA) {
    if (conditionB) {
      if (conditionC) {
        // Do something
      }
    }
  }
};

// Good (flattened logic)
const processData = () => {
  if (!conditionA) return;
  if (!conditionB) return;
  if (!conditionC) return;
  // Do something
};
```

### 5. Error Handling

- Always handle errors gracefully by using `try-catch` blocks or `.catch()` with promises.
- Provide meaningful error messages to aid in debugging and troubleshooting.

**Example**:

```typescript
try {
  const data = await fetchData();
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Error fetching data:', error.message);
}
```

### 6. Avoid Magic Numbers and Strings

- Avoid using raw numbers or strings directly in your code. Instead, define them as constants to improve code readability and maintainability.

**Example**:

```typescript
// Bad (magic number)
if (age >= 18) {
  // Do something
}

// Good (constant)
const MIN_AGE = 18;
if (age >= MIN_AGE) {
  // Do something
}
```

## The Zen of Python (Adapted for TypeScript)

Inspired by Python’s philosophy, here are the principles we apply to our code:

1. **Beautiful is better than ugly**: Write code that is clean and elegant.
1. **Explicit is better than implicit**: Avoid magic numbers and hidden dependencies.
1. **Simple is better than complex**: Strive for simplicity. Complex solutions should be avoided unless absolutely necessary.
1. **Complex is better than complicated**: If complexity is unavoidable, ensure it is well-structured and understandable.
1. **Readability counts**: Code is written for humans first, machines second. Prioritize readability.
1. **Special cases aren’t special enough to break the rules**: Stick to best practices consistently, even for edge cases.
1. **Errors should never pass silently**: Handle errors properly with clear logging or error messages.
1. **In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess**: Make your code and intentions clear.
1. **There should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it**: Avoid unnecessary variation in how tasks are accomplished within the codebase.
1. **If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea**: Code should be easily explainable to other team members.

## Best Practices for Writing Functions

- **Use meaningful names**: Choose descriptive names for functions that clearly convey their purpose.
- **Keep functions short and focused**: Each function should perform a single task.
  - Aim for functions that fit within a single screen (around 20-30 lines).
  - If a function is too long, consider breaking it down into smaller functions.
  - If the function name needs to include “and” or “or,” it may be doing too much.
- **Avoid side effects**: A function should ideally take inputs and return outputs without modifying external state.
- **Write pure functions when possible**: Functions that don’t depend on or modify the outside world (inputs and outputs only) are easier to test and reason about.
- **Avoid long parameter lists**: If a function requires many parameters, consider grouping them into an object or using default values.
- **Use helper functions**: Break down complex logic into smaller, reusable helper functions.
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: Strive for simplicity and clarity in your functions.
- **DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)**: Avoid duplicating code by extracting common logic into functions.

**Example**:

```typescript
// Bad (side effects)
let total = 0;
const calculateTotal = (price: number) => {
  total += price;
};

// Good (pure function)
const calculateTotal = (price: number, currentTotal: number): number => {
  return currentTotal + price;
};


// Bad (long and complex)
function processOrder(order: Order) {
  // side note: should be done in a database transaction

  // Validate order
  if (!order.id || !order.items.length) {
    throw new Error('Invalid order');
  }

  // Calculate total price
  let totalPrice = 0;
  for (const item of order.items) {
    totalPrice += item.price * item.quantity;
  }

  // Apply discount
  if (order.discountCode) {
    totalPrice *= 0.9; // 10% discount
  }

  // Update inventory
  for (const item of order.items) {
    const product = inventory.find(p => p.id === item.productId);
    if (product) {
      product.stock -= item.quantity;
    }
  }

  // Save order to database
  database.save(order);

  return totalPrice;
}

// Good (short and focused, uses helpers, includes JSDoc comments)
/**
 * Processes an order and returns the total price.
 */
function processOrder(order: Order): number {
  // side note: should be done in a database transaction
  validateOrder(order);
  const totalPrice = calculateTotalPrice(order.items);
  const discountedPrice = applyDiscount(order.discountCode, totalPrice);
  updateInventory(order.items);
  saveOrder(order);
  return totalPrice;
}

/**
 * Validates the order.
 */
function validateOrder(order: Order) {
  if (!order.id || !order.items.length) {
    throw new Error('Invalid order');
  }
}
/**
 * Calculates the total price of an order.
 */
function calculateTotalPrice(items: OrderItem[]): number {
  return items.reduce((total, item) => total + item.price * item.quantity, 0);
}

/**
 * Applies a discount to the price if a discount code is provided.
 */
function applyDiscount(discountCode: string, price: number): number {
  return discountCode ? price * 0.9 : price;
}

/**
 * Updates the inventory based on the items in the order.
 */
function updateInventory(items: OrderItem[]) {
  for (const item of items) {
    const product = inventory.find(p => p.id === item.productId);
    if (product) {
      product.stock -= item.quantity;
    }
  }
}

/**
 * Saves the order to the database.
 */
function saveOrder(order: Order) {
  database.save(order);
}
```

## Best Practices for Writing React Components

- **Use Functional Components**: Whenever possible, use functional components with hooks. Class components should be avoided unless absolutely necessary.
- **Separate Logic from Presentation**: Keep logic separate from the presentation layer by using custom [hooks](https://react.dev/reference/react/hooks) or helper functions.
- **Avoid Inline Styles**: Use CSS-in-JS libraries like styled-components or CSS modules for styling. We use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for utility classes.
- **Avoid Deep Component Trees**: Keep component trees shallow to improve performance and readability.
- **Use Memoization**: Use [`useMemo`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useMemo) in a targeted and deliberate manner to memoize components or values to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- **Avoid Using Index as Key**: Whenever possible, avoid using the index of an array as the `key` prop in a list of components. Use a unique identifier instead.
- **Use Context API for Global State**: For global state management, use React’s [Context API](https://react.dev/reference/react/createContext), the [tRPC](https://trpc.io/docs/v10/) cache, or a state management library like [jotai](https://jotai.org/).
- **Write Accessible Components**: Ensure that components are accessible to all users by following best practices for semantic HTML and ARIA attributes. All of our base components use [React Aria](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/) under the hood for Accessibility.

## Problem Solving Best Practices

- **Understand the Problem**: Take the time to fully understand the problem before jumping into coding. Break it down into smaller, manageable parts.
- **Plan Your Approach**: Outline a step-by-step plan to solve the problem. Consider edge cases and potential pitfalls.
- **Stub Out Functions**: Create function stubs with basic return values to simulate the flow of your program. This can help identify potential issues early on.
- **Use Test Cases**: Write test cases to validate your solution. This ensures that your code works as expected and helps catch bugs and edge cases.
- **Write Pseudocode**: Draft pseudocode to map out your logic before writing actual code. This helps in visualizing the solution. Make your pseudocode as detailed and human-readable as possible. Often times, the pseudocode can be directly translated into code with minimal modifications.
- **Test Incrementally**: Test your code in small increments to catch issues early. Use console logs or a debugger to trace the flow of your program.
- **Seek Feedback**: Don’t hesitate to ask for feedback from peers. A fresh perspective can help identify potential improvements or issues.
- **When in Doubt, Research**: If you’re stuck, research similar problems, read documentation, or ask for help. Don’t get discouraged; problem-solving is a skill that improves with practice.
- **Return to Basics**: If you’re struggling with a complex problem, return to the basics. Break it down into simpler parts and build up from there.
- **Refactor**: After solving the problem, review and refactor your code for readability and efficiency. Ensure it adheres to coding standards and best practices.
  - **Optimize for Performance**: If necessary, optimize your code for performance. This could involve reducing time complexity, improving memory usage, or minimizing network requests. Reduce the amount of data sent over the network and avoid unnecessary computations. **Avoid premature optimization; focus on writing clean, readable, working code first.**

## Testing and Code Quality

- **Write Tests**: Every new feature or component should be accompanied by unit tests. We use Jest for testing.
- **Test edge cases**: Ensure your code handles all possible scenarios, especially error cases.
- **Run tests locally**: Before opening a pull request, run the test suite to confirm that all tests pass.

## Code Review Guidelines

- **Peer review is essential**: Every pull request should go through code review by at least one other team member.
- **Be kind and constructive**: Use code reviews as a way to help each other grow and to maintain code quality.
- **Focus on the code, not the person**: Feedback should always be about improving the code, not criticizing the developer.
