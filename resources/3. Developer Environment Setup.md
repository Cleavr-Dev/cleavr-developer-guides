# Development Environment Setup

Welcome! This guide will help you set up your local development environment for working on our **Next.js** application. Please follow these steps carefully to ensure everything runs smoothly.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure your system meets the following requirements:

- **Operating System**: Unix based operating system like macOS or Linux. Preferably MacOS.
- **Git**: Version control is essential. Install the latest version from [Git's official site](https://git-scm.com/). Most Unix-based systems come with Git pre-installed.
- **Node.js**: Our application runs on Node.js, so you'll need to install it. We recommend using **Node.js v20.x.x** or higher. You can download it from [Node.js official site](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm**: We use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) for managing dependencies. Make sure it installed. You can check by running:

  ```bash
    node -v
    npm -v
  ```

  We recommend using npm v8.x.x or higher.
- **Code Editor**: We recommend using Visual Studio Code (VSCode). Ensure you install the following VSCode extensions to improve your development experience:
- [DotENV](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mikestead.dotenv) (Support syntax highlighting for .env files)
- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) (Integrates ESLint JavaScript linter into VS Code)
- [npm Intellisense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=christian-kohler.npm-intellisense) (Autocompletes npm modules in import statements)
- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) - Code formatter (Code formatter using Prettier)
- [Pretty Typescript Errors](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yoavbls.pretty-ts-errors) (Improves TypeScript error messages in VS Code)
- [Prisma](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Prisma.prisma) (Prisma extension for VS Code)
- [Prisma Entity-Relationship Diagram visualizer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bocovo.prisma-erd-visualizer) (Visualize your Prisma schema as an ERD)
- Tailwind CSS IntelliSense (Intellisense for Tailwind CSS)
- XState VSCode (Visual editing, autocomplete and typegen for XState)

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, clone the project repository to your local machine. In your terminal, run the following command:
  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Cleavr-Dev/cleavr.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd cleavr
```

## Step 2: Install Dependencies

Next, install the project dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

## Step 3: Set Up Environment Variables

Our application requires certain environment variables to run. You'll need to create a .env file within `apps/web` and fill it in with the required environment variables. Ask a team member or refer to the project documentation or `.env.example` for the required variables.

## Step 4: Start the Development Server

To start the development server, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the Next.js development server and you should be able to access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Step 5: Git Workflow

Git Workflow will be covered in a separate guide. Please refer to the Git Workflow guide for instructions on how to work with Git in our projects.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during setup, please refer to the following steps:

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly:
    - If you run into issues, try removing the node_modules folder and reinstalling:

    ```bash
    rm -rf node_modules
    npm install
    ```

1. **Check the environment variables**: Ensure the .env.local file is properly set up.

1. **Clear the cache**: If the app behaves unexpectedly, you can try clearing the Next.js cache by running:

```bash
npm run dev -- --clearCache
```

If you’re still facing issues, don’t hesitate to reach out for help on Slack or ask a senior developer for assistance.
